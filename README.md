- 👋 Hi, I’m @lmagnette
- 👀 I’m interested in software development (Java, Kotlin, Angular, Quarkus) 
- 🌱 I’m currently playing a lot with AI (like everybody I guess)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any cool project
- 📫 How to reach me ... I still have to figure this one out but a good start would be social networks [X](https://twitter.com/LoMagnette), [🦋](https://bsky.app/profile/lomagnette.bsky.social)
