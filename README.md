- 👋 Hi, I’m @lmagnette
- 👀 I’m interested in software development (Java, Kotlin, Angular) and the cloud
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot about the cloud and how to use my skill there
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any cool project
- 📫 How to reach me ... I still have to figure this one out but a good start would be on twitter [@LoMagnette](https://twitter.com/LoMagnette)
